# About the project    
> This is a TicTacToe game made using html,css and javascript I used Minimax Algorithm to make the computer play with the user

# What is Minimax Algorithm 
Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence it's a recursive algorithm which is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the other player is also playing optimally.
It is used in games such as tic-tac-toe, go, chess, Isola, checkers, and many other two-player games.
Such games are called games of perfect information because it is possible to see all the possible moves of a particular game.
